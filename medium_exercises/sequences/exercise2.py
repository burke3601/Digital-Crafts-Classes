#2. Matrix Addition
#Given two two-dimensional lists of numbers of the size 2x2 two dimensional list is represented as an list of lists:

list1 = [
    [2, -2],
   [5, 3]
]

list2 = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
]

listsum = []
i = 0
# while i < len(list2):
#     j = 0
#     m = []
#     while j < len(matrix_1[i][j]+matrix[i][j])
#     j += 1
# print(listsum)




# for i in range(len(list1)):
#     for o in range(len(list1[0])):
#         listsum[i][o] = list1[i][o] + list2[i][o]
# for u in listsum:
#     print(u)
